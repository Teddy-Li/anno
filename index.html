<h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:20px;">
<ul style="font-family:arial;font-size:20px;">
    <li>You will be given a sequence of questions, these questions are created by machines, and are hard to understand.</li>
    <li>Each sequence of questions combines to form a query for a certain piece of information from a database.</li>
    <li>You are asked to provide <b>understandable versions of the same question</b>.</li>
    <li>Before you start off, please <b>read the following examples carefully</b>. Each example consists of:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The machine generated question;</li>
        <li>An example of a possible response from the database, presented as a table in 'Database Response';</li>
        <li>An example of a "BAD" English alternative that is still hard to understand;</li>
        <li>An example of a "GOOD" English alternative that is easy to understand;</li>

<h2>Your Task</h2>
<ul style="font-family:arial;font-size:20px;">
    <li>Your job is to read the <b>machine</b> question sequence and <b>machine</b> response table carefully to understand what it asks for, then <b>rewrite the question in your own words</b>, along the lines of the "GOOD" paraphrases above.</li>
    <li>You may either ask the question in one sentence or a few sentences as you wish.</li>
    <li>When you have rewritten the question, please indicate whether the <b>machine</b> question sequence is <b>grammatically valid</b>, whether there are <b>redundant parts</b> and whether it's something that people <b>may actually ask</b>.</li>
    <li>Lastly, please double check your rewritten question on criteria above and also tell us at how many places did you find our <b>machine</b> question sequence hard to understand.</li>
</ul>
